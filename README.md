# PixelLook
Multi platform gaze detector based on It's Written All Over Your Face [1] article.

Includes:
1. Drawing app - draw dots with your eyes
2. Data Collection - saves all pixels looked in a csv file
3. Screen capture - creates video of your screen with mark on the gazed area.
4. Library API - a simple API to use this project to make you own gaze-based app

    </td> </tr></table>

## Webcam requriements ##
1. at least 720p resolution
2. located in the top center of the screen

## Using The API ##
The api made simple as possible.
for example:

```python
from PixeLook import PixeLook

def __main__():
# step 1: get parameters from config file
    configuration()
# step 2: create PixeLook
    my_px_gt = PixeLook_from_config(config['settings'])
# step 3: calibrate 
    my_px_gt.calibrate()
# step 4: use the app as defined mode
    if mode == "dots":
        my_px_gt.draw_live()
    elif mode == "screenshots":
        my_px_gt.start_screen_shots(post=post, webcam=webcam)
    elif mode == "none":
        my_px_gt.run_in_background(post=post)
```
